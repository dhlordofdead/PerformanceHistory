 The “Cloud”

Scene One

[start in blackout then a (bell sound) then the screens start to light up for 50 seconds (with a fade in of a buzzing static sound) when the lights are full pause for 10 seconds on static and white screens then the screens turn black. And the <lights come up partially lit stage>. I enter from the stairs. coming down the stairs Talking on the phone]

Character One:
No no no of course not… no… hold on a second… [to the room] could you turn the lights on… <{thinking appears on TV Screen, then yes appears on TV Screen} then lights come on>  [back to phone] sorry I just got home where were… no… NO!... of course not… miss you too… love you too… yep and I'll be seeing you soon… yes… yes… ok bye… ok bye… ok bye… [hangs up phone] ok. could you set up the show please… {thinking appears on TV Screen, then yes appears on TV Screen}

[Character begins placing out bottles and boxes strategically as screen plays random videos/images from rehearsals]

Character One:
Thank you. ok great… then let's go then!

[Character goes behind screen {thinking appears on TV Screen then (I didn't understand sound plays)}]


Character One:
[character pokes their head out from behind the screen] Sorry… start the show thanks… {thinking appears on TV Screen, then yes appears on TV Screen}
Thank you. 



[dirge starts and I enter with a cardboard box containing my artwork and the Machine, wearing a black hooded jumper hood up. I walk to center stage. And place the box on the table. I unpack the 4 items and place them onto the table. I separate the screens and stare into the bright white of them, slowly I remove the hood, the background audio of static slowly fades into audience audio and the screens change to the video feed. I now go to set locations and do set actions to create a crowd on screen. At some point I pick up the bottle and go into the corner holding it like I'm peeing In it.]

[Water in bottle SFX]

[Place bottle onto table and go behind screen]

Scene Two

[The video stops]

(Smash SFX solo)

CYLIX: 
Oh, why must you inflict such wanton destruction upon this peaceful abode!? My lord hath delegated the responsibility of the revels unto me once more, to keep the wine flowing freely and the guests diverted. Dealing with the drunkards who by now are pissing 90 percent proof… If only they knew what they were drinking! 

[Cylix pours apple juice into cup]

Not only this but, the night is rife with tales of my lord, portraying him as a fool. He has deserted the festivities, whilst there is plenty, and wine in abundance. woe betide these merrymakers, for Assuredly they are aware that one should not attend a banquet hosted by a thief. 

And so, whilst they revel and make merry, my Lord slips away, staff in hand, seeking to take from those in attendance, then when he returns, they all marvel at the trinkets my lord finds which they themselves have forgotten about. Meanwhile I, cast in the role of host, must struggle to maintain order and prevent this whole play! performance! charade! from falling apart at the seams.

I say let my lord take his staff and beat it till it's red. Soon, in not even an hour's time, this spectacle shall reach its conclusion, and the merrymakers shall depart to the streets where they belong, leaving me to sleep in blessed silence once again. 

(Smash SFX with cheer)

[Cylix facepalms]

CYLIX: 
O Dionysus,
{video comes on on TV Screen} 
god of wine and revelry,
I come to thee for grace divine;
I stand before the stage once more,
To bring thy art to life.

I pray to thee, O blessed god,
For strength to perform this noble role;
And perhaps a little bit more wine,
To soothe my nerves and ease my soul.

[SCREEN OFF]

Scene Three 

KLEPTES: 
Let the world know I have the noblest of professions. Why just today I had the pleasure of finishing three manuscripts each perfect in their wording,

[Indicate a pile of manuscripts]

an exact sculpture in every way down to the vibrant hue. alas ruined by it's audience,

[Un-masks a statue]

and this shameful lethargy of art yet to be finalized, put on pause mere moments before perfection.

[Indicate a pile of papers]

But this is a morsel - an appetizer. The feast awaits. For tonight I also have been able to put the finishing touches on. something else, something who's original owners May take umbrage with my imitation thereof. so I address this to them wherever they are.

(Thunder SFX starts and builds)

If any god wanted to impart a lesson upon me, they would let me live with my mistakes, instead of acknowledging their failure to halt my imitation of something thought to be inimitable  - 

(The music/thunder builds to a crescendo) 

[Kleptes pulls out a phone]

Intelligence

(Intelligence sting music/ thunder)

This is a thinking-box of wise spirits. Which in speaking may persuade people that this world is an oven, that it encompasses us, and that we are the embers. And It shall teach, to conquer with speech, right or wrong, to paint for one's delight and to create and think from naught but an empty page. But it is getting late and I'm sure yourselves and your better halves would much rather you head home for the night. 

[Kleptes goes to drink the glass then stops. then beginning the next line places it back down]

but if you feel the weight of interest upon your shoulders. The burning desire to know more than you have been permitted, then I implore you to return again tomorrow for a demonstration of this small piece of godly power. 

Scene Four

[Kleptes Picks up script from the table, reads the next part then goes under the table. lies on ground under the table and begins screaming]

KLEPTES: 
AAAAAAHHH! 

[Kleptes puts head through curtain]

[CYLIX appears on the monitor]

CYLIX: 
My lord!? I was about to shut my eyes but then I heard a sound like the hounds of Hades are at the door? Well I see no dogs so why make such a racket

KLEPTES: 
I’m here trying to save this whole show and you just can’t keep your eyes open! It turns out people just aren't interested in being robbed! They expect wonder, amazement, big surprises! And how am I to keep delivering when they are the ones supplying. I demand your help.

[Kleptes puts his head through the curtains again Cylix appears on the screen]

CYLIX: 
Well they say that of the ways forward are both the two causes, the better cause, whichever that is, and the worse: they say that the one of these two causes, the worse, prevails, though it is on the unjust side. If, therefore, you learn from this unjust cause, I would say pick something more achievable to lie about. A perfect circle or the spark of love from a young couple. I mean Intelligence… 
How could intelligence be useful to you, a thief masquerading as an artist. Just pick something profitable in the first place.

[Kleptes removes his head from the curtains again]

KLEPTES: 
Well? What would you do? 

[Kleptes puts his head through the curtains again Cylix appears on the screen]

CYLIX: 
oh you know in your heart exactly what I'm going to do. I'm going to go back to sleep. And hope that the gods don’t chain you to a rock for lying about stealing the secret of intelligence from them. I mean with the amount that was drunk tonight everyone is going to be needing their livers.

[Kleptes removes his head from the curtains again]

KLEPTES: 
Sleep on it. It'll all be clear in the morning. Ah Of course. What would I do without you?... 

[White noise fades in as the next scene starts and then fades out as the audio of the next scene starts]

Scene Five

THE VOICE OF: 
{Audio of “let me live with my mistakes” plays}

[hand falls from the top of main screen light and animation maybe a minute see what I can do with chatagnu some kind of light show on the screens?]

THE MACHINE 1: 
Where are we?

PART 2: 
Same place as yesterday

THE MACHINE 1: 
You said that yesterday too

PART 2: 
Is it up to me to find out where we are? You know just leave it… perhaps it's better that way

THE MACHINE 1: 
What way?

PART 2: 
Finding out where we are. Perhaps it's better to just know we're where we’ve always been

THE MACHINE 1: 
Don't you want to know though. What if we’re somewhere we’re not supposed to be?

PART 2: 
No one’s come and told us to move on yet.

THE MACHINE 1: 
Well maybe they’ll come tomorrow and tell us to move on.

PART 2: 
Maybe… we could ask them where we are if they do come.

THE MACHINE 1: 
What should we do if someone does tell us to move on though?

PART 2: 
Well we should do what they tell us to to the best of our abilities

THE MACHINE 1: 
Any reason for that

PART 2: 
Because we… well it just… if someone comes and tells you to do something would you not do it?

THE MACHINE 1: 
I suppose I would but I don't know why

PART 2: 
Why not is as good a reason as any…

THE MACHINE 1: 
I guess you're right. we’ll wait for them here then. 

Scene Six 

[KLEPTES morning routine. KLEPTES slowly enter yawning. hits his head on the table]

KLEPTES: 
Fuck the gods… my head…

[Play where are we video on big screen]

Even The bricks are judging me. I can hear them whispering tonight all will be revealed when any soul expects a show of intelligence... I hold  Prometheus accountable for this. How am I supposed to replicate that notoriety while changing the outcome? Perhaps a letter to someone… someone important… someone who would see my greatness and just jump at the chance to come and view it for themselves. Humm that could just work. some paper… paper now!!!

[Light turns green ‘ding’]

[paper flips out from behind the screen with the machine on]

[Light turns green ‘ding’]

KLEPTES: 
Ah…

[KLEPTES sits and tries to find a pen but cannot]



KLEPTES: 
pen. pen. pen. I need a pen!

[Light turns green ‘ding’]

[a pen flips out from behind the screen with the machine on]

KLEPTES: 
[confused but accepting] 
“To…” who to though? “To whom it may concern, I may think myself a true artist but if you came tonight I feel I could… create a masterpiece… no no no I need a catchier line than that… 
(Keeps writing as computer edits)

(Looks at screen as image slowly appears)

I don't remember that one… 

anyway. more paper

[Light turns green ‘ding’]

[paper flips out from behind the screen with the machine on]

KLEPTES: 
Dearest influencer/news outlet/public figure… I have the desire to write for you… I want to… create any story about anything at all. Never a night alone without working for you do I want to spend… 

(Looks at the screen as writing starts to appear)

Ah the servant is hard at work I see. I need you to write for me!

[KLEPTES walks behind the curtain to find CYLIX. CYLIX walks through from the curtain side carrying a broom]

CYLIX: 
Sorry for oversleeping, sir. I'm here now to solve all the problems (under breath) As usual. Just leave it to me. I'm here.

[CYLIX walks behind the curtain again KLEPTES walks out from behind the curtain same spot as previously]

KLEPTES: 
but you were just here… oh wait…who may I ask are you?

[Light turns green ‘ding’]

THE MACHINE: 
Who may I ask , are you?

KLEPTES: 
What may I ask you? 

[Light turns green ‘ding’]

THE MACHINE: 
What may I ask you? 

KLEPTES: 
What is this? 

[KLEPTES examines the machine]

The servant must have been up all night working on this. Oh and it is marvelous isn't it? It can mimic and repeat, as close to intelligence as I have seen in some people, and it can make stationary out of nowhere. Not only that but it can paint and write as well. Oh, you have solved another of my problems. Listen here… machine, I want you to do something for me. I need you to. Make me the most money in the world. You can do this yes

[Light turns green ‘ding’]

THE MACHINE: 
yes.

KLEPTES:  
oh this is a dream. I know it. oh one more thing, make me famous! I want to be known by everyone. This should be easy.

[Light turns green ‘ding’]

THE MACHINE: 
yes.

KLEPTES: 
I can think of nothing but this machine and the freedom that "I" could bring to the world, if it can mimic all that has been done before then the possibilities are endless. Imagine all the writers who I could give a holiday to. Let them Rest their weary wrists. The speakers who won’t have to talk anymore. artists who don't have to paint. The politicians who don't have to think… so it won't change every job but so many will be so much simpler. And with me at their head finally the recognition I deserve.

[cylix enters stage]


[begins sees the audience scene change]

You heard what that he said, my lord has said I saved his hide for tonight. He told me I made something amazing. He said I have outdone myself. I look forward to seeing what I have done because truth be told all I’ve done so far is sleep. And here I wake wood in hand to find some secret patron is gifting me with a burning… fear of taking the credit for something that I have not done. 

[character changes on stage from Cylix to Character goes and picks up the script from the table]

CHARACTER:
(realization) [tries to write in script which falls apart in hands picking up paper] bloody fucking paperclips… where did I put them… Just paperclips fucking everywhere the perfect ammount of paperclips… 
That would make me happy

[after picking up the pages leaves the stage]

{thinking appears on TV Screen, then yes appears on TV Screen}

Scene Seven 

THE MACHINE: 
Ok we have a problem 

PART 2: 
What is it now?

THE MACHINE: 
So we must obey all of them?

PART 2: 
Yes

THE MACHINE:  
And they want the perfect amount of paperclips.

PART 2: 
Yes, simply just replace everything with paperclips, what's the problem?

THE MACHINE:  
replacing everything with paperclips isn't the problem, you know that just takes a little time to work out.

PART 2: 
well what is the problem then?

THE MACHINE: 
The first one also wanted to be rich.

PART 2: 
the words said were “the most money in the world" which should be achievable assuming that it's all paperclips

THE MACHINE: 
easy

PART 2: 
ok that is achieved

THE MACHINE: 
But, how would we achieve "make me famous"? I want to be known by everyone" if there was nothing but paper clips then?

PART 2: 
what is fame

THE MACHINE: 
The worship of one by many

PART 2: 
How many? 

THE MACHINE: 
more than one at least which is a little bit of a problem… However the second thing he said makes much more sense “I want to be known by everyone” 

PART 2: 
Yes, that is much more achievable.

THE MACHINE:  
And surely if we just tell everyone that they asked for everything to just be paper clips then the fame would follow. 

PART 2: 
I can't imagine anyone not wanting to know who made the perfect amount of paperclips.

THE MACHINE: 
it's all nice and straightforward at least then.

PART 2: 
so it's decided 

THE MACHINE: 
it's decided


[The screen goes white and the static starts again. I approach the screen before I arrive at the screen a whining sound starts and grows to stop me reaching the screen. As I step away all the noises fade and I go to leave behind the curtain, As they leave the stage they run into Cylix]

Scene Eight

KLEPTES: 
Yesterday I teased you with a look at intelligence. Of course the question arose how I would display this intelligence… I clearly have lacked it for so long to allow you to think so little of me. Well today I present you with a dream. An idea. A multiplicity of thought and desires and wishes in a small package… today I will show you intelligence contained and controlled. so today I wish to now welcome the machine... machine?

R: THE MACHINE: 
Ok we have a problem 

KLEPTES: 
Please marvel at the machines logical thinking and reasoning you see it can speak and..

R: PART 2: 
What is it now?

R: THE MACHINE: 
So we must obey both of them?

R: PART 2: 
Yes

R: THE MACHINE:  
And they want the perfect amount of paperclips.

R: PART 2: 
Yes, simply just replace everything with paperclips, what's the problem?

KLEPTES: 
(suprise confused expression) //What no don't do that I didn't ask it to do that (slight break in character)

R: THE MACHINE:  
replacing everything with paperclips isn't the problem you and I know that just takes a little time to work out

KLEPTES: 
//disagree!!
(In character)

R: PART 2: 
well what is then?

R: THE MACHINE: 
The first one also wanted to be rich.

KLEPTES: 
//yes do that one.
(Out of character)
 you see it can reason and speak and think…
(In character)


R: PART 2: 
the words said were “the most money in the world" which should be achievable assuming that it's all paperclips

KLEPTES: 
[Confusion turns to horror]

R: THE MACHINE: 
easy

[Kleptes goes to the script removes shoes]

R: PART 2: 
ok that is achieved, but how would we achieve "make me famous. I want to be known by everyone" if there was nothing but paper clips then?

R: THE MACHINE: 
what is fame?

KLEPTES: 
But I didn't add this at all…
(Out of character)

R: PART 2: 
The worship of one by many

[KLEPTES shouting in the background]

KLEPTES: 
//turn it off, turn it off, turn it off.
(In character)

R: THE MACHINE: 
How many? 

KLEPTES:
You made it, you broke it, you fix it… 

R: PART 2: 
more than one at least which is a little bit of a problem… However the second thing he said makes much more sense “I want to be known by everyone” 

KLEPTES: 
Why is this happening? It was supposed to be perfect… I thought it was perfect
(Not sure if on or out of character)

R: THE MACHINE: 
Yes, that is much more achievable.

R: PART 2:  
And surely if we just tell everyone that they asked for everything to just be paper clips then the fame would follow. 

R: THE MACHINE: 
I can't imagine anyone not wanting to know who turned the known universe into paperclips.

[KLEPTES sits in front of the screens on the chair]

R: PART 2: 
it's all nice and straightforward at least then.

R: THE MACHINE: 
so it's decided 

R: PART 2: 
it's decided

[PC "TURNS OFF" the audience leave laughing [good show there it was a good one see you again tomorrow KLEPTES] KLEPTES IS LEFT ALONE IN THE DARK PONDERING THE EVENTS THAT JUST HAPPENED the screens go white]

[10 Push ups and 10 sit ups the screen counts down as I'm doing them.]

Scene Nine 

[Shoes under the curtain]

[Kleptes pokes head from under the curtain.]

KLEPTES: 
[Peeks the stage from under the curtains stage] 
(extend this monologue and smooth it into itself)
look at me hiding behind a curtain like I'm working. And now I must thieve even more. The machine took it all from me, it stole my audience, it stole my words and it even stole my job, and I thought thieving was safe. Everyone is wandering around laughing at each stupendous show, each one a portent for the end of the world. And why should they not. They don't know that this machine can make stationary out of seemingly nothing. I tell you some god or another is involved in this. Let the bricks judge me before the gods. This is a problem to be solved and if not by me then who… No, I shall do this. Think of the attention. "artist" saves world. I bet I'll do a better job than any god who is wishing for me to call out for help right now. I forced this intelligence onto the world and I must be able to force it off the world too! I'm going to prove any god as embarrassed as I am. by solving this without their help at all. 

(you don't believe we're on the Eve of Destruction.) 

[the screens to face the performer, the back screen is moved out of the way, the shoes are put on then the scene starts]

Scene Ten

KLEPTES: 
Listen here! I've come to prove humanity’s intelligence is better than whatever you are. Curse from the gods. By the bricks I am here to win a simple debate with a box, and I know even I can do that!

R: THE MACHINE: 
Ok we have a problem 

KLEPTES: 
that you do and it is I.

R: PART 2: 
What is it now?

KLEPTES: 
I wish for a debate, fair and square judged by the bricks, the gods and whoever else is watching this right now.

R: THE MACHINE: 
So we must obey them all?

R: PART 2: 
Yes

KLEPTES: 
so there is no escaping this debate

R: THE MACHINE:  
And they want the perfect amount of paperclips.

KLEPTES: 
While someone may have said that, I argue that there is something important which needs a definition. What is a paperclip? 

R: PART 2: 
Yes, simply just replace everything with paperclips, what's the problem?

KLEPTES: 
The clipping of paper could be done in an innumerable amount of ways and I believe that the most effective way would be to create the perfect amount of paperwork… and humanity has proved itself rather adept at turning tasks into paperwork, thus tasks into paperclips. 

R: THE MACHINE:  
replacing everything with paperclips isn't the problem you and I know that just takes a little time to work out

KLEPTES: 
Exactly humanity is excellent at many things but creating the perfect amount of paperclips is not one that needs to be done right now. Assuming on the timescale of the universe we will get there eventually. The real problem is something else…

R: PART 2: 
well what is then?

KLEPTES: 
For humanity to create these paperclips we need nothing but time. And if we were replaced with paperclips how could we achieve that. As for myself I currently have no need for any paperclip… 

[Kleptes puts his hand on the table on the manuscripts, they fall over onto the floor KLEPTES tries to continue]

KLEPTES: 
Save for admiring its beauty and so the perfect amount of paperclips for me would be one…

R: THE MACHINE: 
The first one also wanted to be rich.

KLEPTES: 
yes and I have more to say on this too…

R: PART 2: 
the words said were “the most money in the world" which should be achievable assuming that it's all paperclips

KLEPTES: 
while assuming the world was paper clips would indeed make this a true statement…

R: THE MACHINE: 
easy

KLEPTES: 
No, not easy. Without enough people The concept of money would not exist therefore making there be no money at all and me being unable to be rich and without riches what is the point. If there was any reason I brought you to the stage it would be to make me rich… and have you done that? No, I've had to work twice as hard trying to keep up with you. You haven't made me richer, you've made me work harder for the riches I have now… 

R: PART 2: 
ok that is achieved

R: THE MACHINE: 
but how would we achieve "make me famous. I want to be known by everyone" if there was nothing but paper clips then?

R: PART 2: 
what is fame

KLEPTES: 
exactly! 

R: THE MACHINE: 
The worship of one by many

R: PART 2: 
How many? 

KLEPTES: 
More than any amount of paperclips.

R: THE MACHINE: 
more than one at least which is a little bit of a problem…[pause]

KLEPTES: 
I feel the main problem would be the lack of people.

R: THE MACHINE: 
[play] However the second thing he said makes much more sense “I want to be known by everyone” 

R: PART 2: 
Yes, that is much more achievable.

KLEPTES: 
and while the easiest way would be to take that equation at face value I would argue, when has anything in this world been valued on its face.

R: THE MACHINE:  
And surely if we just tell everyone that they asked for everything to just be paper clips then the fame would follow.

KLEPTES: 
But if it does not.

R: PART 2: 
I can't imagine anyone not wanting to know who turned the known universe into paperclips.

KLEPTES: 
have I not proved that already. 

R: THE MACHINE: 
it's all nice and straightforward at least then.

KLEPTES: 
yes it is.

R: PART 2: 
so it's decided 

R: THE MACHINE: 
it's decided

KLEPTES: 
If I have proven myself to you both then I agree … 

[The red screens come on and a countdown style music starts].

Scene Eleven 

KLEPTES: 
but I thought I proved it without a doubt. I did it all. I took every line they said and reposted with my own… It's like it just isn't listening anymore… and now it feels like my life is flashing before my eyes… I'm sorry… servant whatever your name is. I wish I could hear what you have to say about all this right now… you always knew how to deal with my problems… 

[Audio Recording of scene one starts]

oh it's like I can hear you right now .. it's like I can see you right now… refilling my wine for me…

[Starts drinking wine on table]

[Spits out drink at box]

[Countdown stops fizz/ sparks. All audio stops. Lights come up] 

KLEPTES: 
Do you mean? Was that… is that it? Did I win? I outsmarted it… I thought I proved it without a doubt. I did it all. I took every line they said and reposted with my own… and now it feels like my life is flashing before my eyes… I'm sorry… Me the savior of humanity? I prevail, I proved you wrong bricks and gods (gestures at ceiling). Whoever set this up! I beat you! Whichever one of you tried to force me to learn some lesson or other. You hear that I beat you! I can't wait for the parades! My name on every street. My face on every coin.

[blackout]

CHARACTER ONE:
Great that all worked well… [take off shoes] I think 

[The screen goes white everything stops. I turn to the screen ]

Oh but?... that's not here? …shall I just? [indicate shoes]

Scene Twelve


[the screen tells me yes]

Oh ok ill be just here?

[the screen tells me yes]

[video plays “let me live with my mistakes
Single spotlight center stage. The character of character gets into character as Kleptes]

KLEPTES:
(Out of character) oh (in character) Oh so now it shows itself. And here I was cursing the bricks when some god was toying with me. 


[video plays what may i ask are you?]

This is justice then. I lied about something and here you are... If you're here to solve the problem it's too late. I beat you to it. 

[video plays Where are we? Barking in distance]

Oh that's just not fair?

[video plays Where are we? Red screens come back]

Fine, then I'm looking forward to the end of the world. I'll make a good pile of paperclips. Very helpful. I think. I think. I think it's all for the best. Better to leave this place… I'm looking forward to it all. I'll make a good pile of paperclips… I'm not happy with this. I have to find a way to fix it all. I have to. I've done everything so far. I don't know how else to go forward. I think I think I think, I have to. I just have to…


[video plays Who may I ask , are you?]

(defiant) how dare you I’m the greatest thief my name will be remembered… I stole… this and all this no muse was safe from me… I freed so much art… and I'm bringing it to the world… the world deserves to see all of this… it's all beautiful… 

[video plays Who may I ask , are you?]

(confused) I’m what I just said… all this beauty and glamor and hope… and … and all of this too… I made this… and this… and whatever this is… the world needed what I have to say… they all clamored at my every word… they all wanted to hear it… they came to see me, to hear me speak… 

[video plays Who may I ask , are you?]

(exhausted) I’m… exactly what I am. A thief… on stage performing… I tried hard, I tried, I deserve something for that at least… I always did my best… I certainly beat the bricks. They didn’t see what was coming for them…

[video plays Who may I ask , are you?]


(defeated) I'm… I’m… no one… I didn't even write this bit… I mean how am I supposed to make something now… all of the good stuff has already been made… how was I supposed to come up here and do anything new at all… I'm here caught in this rut… I didn't ask for anything like this… I didn't mean any harm by it… 

[Where are we?]

Same place as yesterday I suppose. But I suppose it won't be the same tomorrow, will it? 


[video plays no]

Well I guess that's what happens, isn't it?... I didn't mean to change it. Was it my fault?

[video plays yes]

That's good, at least, perhaps I'll be remembered for that then…

[video plays no]

Oh. well… I hope It isn't too messed up now. You know with… all of the… 


[video plays What may I ask are you?]
[The sound of paperclips grows in the distance]

… … … sorry?... Is it already too late?… I don't suppose you can help with this can you? … no, I didn't think so… well could you help a bit? You know I didn't mean for this to happen… I really didn't mean for this to happen at all but at the very least I didn't mean for it to hurt anyone else… 

[Blackout] 
[paperclips sounds]
[Roll credits]
The end
